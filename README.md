# project1
This was the first website I ever designed for my web design class. This was made back in August 2018. I am in awe at how far I have come since this project in my ability to design websites. In the future, I would like to redesign this website to make it more visually appealing and make it responsive.

# Documents Folder Contains Design Journey
The Design Journey documents the decisions I made throughout the development of the project and contains the reasoning for them.

# What I Learned From This Project
- Structuring a website using HTML
- Designing using CSS
- Conducting User Tests
I learned how valuable user testing is and how it is incredibly essential for enhancing user experience.
During user tests, I paid close attention to where users were most inclined to look and click.
Understanding the mindset of the user is critical in web development. It helps the developer to make more informed decisions on where to place certain information.
User testing even allowed me to improve my design and learn what was most visually appealing to users.
