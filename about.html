        My name is Ashley Ticzon and I am a sophomore at Cornell University from the Silicon Valley! I study Information Science with concentrations in User Experience and Interactive Technologies. My major was originally Industrial and Labor Relations. I decided to change it after I took my first coding class, Python, here at Cornell last Spring and <strong> I fell in love  with coding. </strong> Now anything STEM related catches my interest and I can&rsquo;t wait to continue diving in deeper into the field.
      </p>

      <p class= "aboutintro">
        Now if there is one thing you should know about me is that <strong>my veins run Big Red!</strong> I have immense pride in being a Cornellian and as a history geek I know tons of fun facts about the history of Cornell. If you walked around campus with me you could point out any building to me and I&rsquo;d be able to tell you the history of the building and who the building is named after.

        <p class="letter">
          The first time I stepped foot on campus was in the Spring of 2015, since my brother at the time was a freshman at Cornell.
        </p>

        <p>
          I really learned from that visit that <q>spring</q> in Ithaca doesn&rsquo;t have the same meaning as it does in California... I remember packing for the trip and putting shorts and tank tops into my suitcase. But, my Mom told me to repack because I would need pants and a <strong> snow jacket!</strong> I recall being very confused and somewhat appalled. Since to me spring is when it&rsquo;s warm and sunny outside.
        </p>

        <p>
          The snow on that trip didn&rsquo;t bother me. I actually enjoyed it. Maybe this is because snow was sort of new to me. In fact, snow is sort of part of the reason why I ended up deciding to come to Cornell (haha)!
        </p>

        <p>
          When I seriously started thinking about applying to colleges I honestly didn&rsquo;t feel too enthusiastic about possibly staying in California. That&rsquo;s probably an odd statement since I know moving to California is so many people&rsquo;s dreams. However, look at it from my perspective. I had spent my entire life in California. Staying in California would have just been like staying at home for me even if I was a few hundred miles away from the Bay Area. From my college experience I really wanted to leave the nest and go experience something brand new.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had known for a long time that I wanted to be in New York. When I was little I would say <strong><q> I am moving to New York!</q></strong> a lot. Thus, it sort of made sense to me to choose to apply to Cornell Early Decision because New York had been a dream of mine for so long and Cornell had the program I wanted.
        </p>

        <p>
          I feel like my life had been secretly leading me to Cornell in numerous ways.
        <p>

          <ul>
            <li> I remember reading <cite> Charlotte&rsquo;s Web </cite> by E.B. White &rsquo;21 multiple times with my Mom.</li>

            <li> The <em>most vivid memory</em> I have from my childhood was when I was 3 years old watching Norah Jones sing <cite> Don&rsquo;t Know Why </cite> to the photograph of the letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; on <cite> Sesame Street</cite>. After hearing her sing I marched right up to my Dad and told him to buy me the song. <cite> Don&rsquo;t Know Why </cite> is one of my lifelong favorite songs and it turns out it was written by Cornellian, Jesse Harris &rsquo;91. Sometimes I walk around campus and I wonder if the inspiration for the song came from an experience here at Cornell. Harris by the way is an amazing guitarist and he learned how to play guitar while he was a student here!</li>

            <li> I used to watch <cite>The Simpsons</cite> all the time with my family when I was little. Sideshow Mel in the show is a Cornell alumnus. Plus, there is an episode where Lisa wears a Cornell sweatshirt! </li>
          </ul>

          <img class="ball"  src="images/ball.jpg" alt="Me with the crystal ball from the Wizard of Oz." />
          <!-- This is my own personal photo-->

          <ul>
            <li> The actor who played the Wizard in the <cite>The Wizard of Oz</cite> attended Cornell and the owner of the witch&rsquo;s crystal ball is a Cornell alumnus! The crystal ball last year was on display in the lobby of the Department of Rare and Manuscript Collections.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="diploma">
            <img class="Bernard" src="images/diploma.jpg" alt="A photo of me with Andy Bernard's Cornell diploma" />
            <!-- This is my own personal photo -->

            <!-- This is my own personal photo -->
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li> I used to watch <cite>The Office</cite> when the show was airing. I started watching it around the time that Andy became the manager. I had zero idea what Cornell was when it would be brought up during the show. I actually think I thought it was a fake school that they made up... I really wasn&rsquo;t aware of the Ivy League until my brother got accepted to Cornell. <strong> Fun Fact! </strong> I got to see the Cornell diploma they used in Andy&rsquo;s office when he became manager! It turns out Cornell&rsquo;s Head Archivist bought it off of eBay when the show ended. Plus, he had Ed Helms sign it when came in 2014 to do the Commencement speech at Cornell!</li>
