        Hi, my name is Ashley Ticzon! If you&rsquo;re curious about Cornell and what it&rsquo;s like to be a Cornell student this is the site for you! I&rsquo;ve experienced some of the greatest things Cornell has to offer some usual and some sort of <em>unusual </em>and I&rsquo;d love to share those experiences with you!
      </p>

      <br />

      <p> So cheers to Cornell for bringing us together!</p>

        <p class="letter">
          From the title of this blog post you can tell that there are a lot of changes going on and it quite literally means major changes as in I am changing my major here at Cornell! I&rsquo;m going to be going from Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) to Information Science in Arts and Sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Academically, I am in a far different place than I anticipated I would be a year ago. Since first semester Ashley would have never expected that she would venture into the dark unknown of a typical ILRie and delve into Information Science. (If you aren&rsquo;t aware, the ILRie stereotype is that we can&rsquo;t do anything STEM related. It is a frequent joke on the Cornell Facebook meme page and actually quite a true reality.)
        </p>

        <p>
          So, what exactly brought on this change? Well, when I came to Cornell as an eager freshman I really thought I was interested in ILR. In high school I had done a lot of political organizing for campaigns and social justice work. I thought that my career path would be starting out in human resources and then make my way up to upper management. However, as I took ILR classes I felt uninterested. There really was no spark in what I was doing. I was just going through the motions of what needed to be done. When I hung out with my ILR friends who were enthusiastic about their courses I couldn’t relate. This led to a lot of internal conflict during my first semester.
        </p>

        <p>
          I felt confused. I thought I wanted ILR, yet in the end I didn&rsquo;t. I knew that I didn&rsquo;t want to be in ILR anymore, but I didn&rsquo;t know what I would do if I left ILR. Plus, I never even wanted to admit that I didn&rsquo;t love ILR. It was complicated because I had a brother who was in ILR, I worked in admissions (my face is all over their social media page) and so many of my friends were in ILR. I didn&rsquo;t confront the idea that I wanted to leave ILR until about <strong>3 days before second semester!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Essentially what happened was that I went through a <strong>full on existential crisis!</strong> I questioned what I was doing here at Cornell and how I felt like I didn’t fit in. When my brother suggested that I look at Information Science a wave of clarity flew over me. Information Science sparked my interest more than ILR ever did. Thus, in a span of less than 24 hours I decided to change my entire schedule to have computer science and math courses!
        </p>

        <p>
          I feel like <em>normal</em> people would have thought about the decision more in depth and maybe waited at least a whole day. But, when I decide I want something I just do it. Usually, when I decide to do things I do think rationally. Just that once I decide on something you can&rsquo;t make me change my mind. There is no going back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deciding to go into Information Science was definitely an interesting choice that I, and everyone who knew me, did not foresee. Everyone around me was saying, “What are you doing? You&rsquo;re in ILR. You don&rsquo;t know how to code.” I mean I can&rsquo;t blame them for questioning me since ILR has zero to do with STEM. Plus, I would always joke about how the Cornell Daily Sun has called ILR, The Sexiest Major at Cornell. Besides, one important fact is that I really didn’t know how to code.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you had asked me to write the simple string of &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; I would have looked at you confused. I had never taken a programming class before I took Python (CS 1110) here at Cornell during my second semester.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey with learning my first programming language brought on a lot of challenges. There would be large spans of time where I had zero idea what was going on. I had never had to think in such a systematic and logical way before. Yet, there would be these moments of clarity where I finally understood what I was doing in class. In those moments I would text my Mom on how I love Python so much! These moments of pure elation I never experienced when I was finished reading pages upon pages in ILR classes. I never once texted my mom that I was elated because I just finished my weekly assignment of reading 400 pages of Labor History.
        </p>


        <p>
          Even though I&rsquo;m no wiz kid at coding (yet) the feelings I get when my code runs properly outweighs the hours of frustration. I actually love coding! I think it&rsquo;s so fun that if you met me you might roll your eyes at me! I&rsquo;ve been practicing writing in HTML a lot to the point that when I text my friends I&rsquo;ll include the HTML tags in my message so they will subconsciously start learning HTML!
        </p>

        <p>
          The existential crisis I had before second semester may have been one of the greatest things to happen to me. I was forced to face my dissatisfaction with ILR and it led me to Information Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now as I delve more into Information Science and Computer Science classes anything that is STEM related catches my eye. With this change in my major I will be getting the most out of my time here at Cornell.
        </p>

        <p>
          I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what I will do once I leave Cornell. I&rsquo;m not really worried about that though. It seems that my life is leading me to a lot of surprises that will naturally unveil for me a destiny greater than I imagined.
